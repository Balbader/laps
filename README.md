## 5-Step Business Growth Framework  
_A step-by-step, bullet-point guide based on the transcript_

---

### Before You Start
- Treat this like you just paid $10,000 for it.
- Show up focused for the next ~20 minutes.
- Goal: go from “vague idea” → “clear intellectual property” → “money.”

---

## Step 1. Create a Product With Proof Behind It

### 1.1 Find your “proof story”
- Look back at the last 5 years of your life/work.
- Identify moments where:
  - You did something *special*.
  - That “something” is interesting to a specific type of person (your ICP = Ideal Customer Persona).
  - You got a **quantifiable result** (numbers, outcomes).
  - You can walk someone through **how you did it step-by-step**.
  - You can **name** the outcome.

> A “proof story” =  
> - I did something valuable  
> - for someone specific  
> - got a clear result  
> - gave that result a name  
> - and can teach how to get it

### 1.2 Examples of proof stories
- Example: “Key Person of Influence”
  - Worked with top CEOs/speakers to get them on stages, sell books, build authority.
  - Named the outcome: “Become a Key Person of Influence.”
  - Built a 5-step method.
  - Resulted in a book and a global business accelerator.
- Example: Ronley Vaz
  - Restaurant owner in serious debt (~$500K).
  - Built a successful food podcast.
  - Turned that proof into an “audio marketing agency.”
  - Signed first major clients in 30 days.
  - Paid off debt and had >$20K cash in 6 months.

### 1.3 Extract the Intellectual Property (IP)
- Your IP = your story + your method + your language + your emotional angle.
- This IP should be:
  - Relevant to your ICP.
  - Repeatable.
  - Branded (give it a name).

### 1.4 Turn your IP into 2 products
1. **Product for Prospects**
   - Purpose: lets people learn about your method.
   - Formats:
     - Webinar
     - Online assessment / quiz
     - Mini-course
     - Free workshop
   - Must answer:
     - What special thing happened?
     - Who is it for?
     - What result can they expect?
     - What are the steps?
     - What do we call this outcome?

   - Needs:  
     - A **landing page** that explains all of the above.

2. **Core Offering**
   - Purpose: deliver the result.
   - Formats:
     - Done-for-you agency service
     - Software
     - Consulting / advisory / coaching
     - Physical product
   - Needs:
     - A **slide deck or brochure** that clearly explains:
       - What will be delivered
       - How it works
       - How much it costs
       - What result they should expect

> Summary of Step 1:  
> - Find your proof story.  
> - Name the outcome.  
> - Turn it into:
>   - Free “learn it” product (for prospects)  
>   - Paid “get it delivered” product (core offering)

## Step 2. Get Attention

> Attention = oxygen. No attention → no leads → no sales → no business.

You must become:
1. **Noticed**
2. **Known**
3. **Rated**

### 2.1 Become Noticed
- “Noticed” = people are aware you exist.
- Reality: People typically only “notice you” the 11th time they see you.
- That means:
  - You need at least **11 short-form content pieces** in front of them.
  - Those 11 touches must happen within **90 days**.
- Best practice:
  - Post **every single day**.
  - Use short, punchy content:
    - Short LinkedIn posts
    - Short Instagram clips/reels
    - Image carousels
    - Quick talking-head videos
- Why daily?
  - If you post daily, every ~2 weeks a new person can accumulate 11 touches and finally notice you.
  - The biggest creators post 5–10 times per day to accelerate this effect.

### 2.2 Become Known
- “Known” = people feel like they actually understand you and what you can do.
- Research: People need **2–7 hours** with you to feel like they “know you.”
- This requires **long-form content**:
  - 1,500+ word post or report
  - Long YouTube video / webinar / training
  - Guest appearance on a podcast
  - A keynote / workshop (live or recorded)
  - A book
- Your job:
  - Give people a way to “binge you” for 2–7 hours after they notice you in short form.

### 2.3 Become Rated
- “Rated” = people understand where you sit in the market and what you cost.
- Buyers mentally classify you:
  - Discount (cheap, low-end)
  - Mass market (commodity)
  - Niche (community, passion, specialist)
  - Luxury (high-ticket, exclusive)
- You influence how you’re rated through **association with other brands**.
  - When people see you next to certain brands, they assume you’re in that tier.
  - Example: You in a Rolls-Royce + private jet + Four Seasons + Dom Pérignon = “luxury.”
- Tactics:
  - Publicly mention / show logos of brands you’ve worked with.
  - Show your environment, your clients, your results.

### 2.4 Mini case studies
- Annie Filipova
  - Ramped short-form content.
  - Produced long-form content.
  - Repeatedly referenced major brands she worked with.
  - Became one of the most influential people on LinkedIn in Greece.
- The speaker
  - Had tons of long-form content but not enough short-form.
  - Cut long-form into daily clips.
  - Result: hundreds of thousands of new followers → more attention → more business.

> Summary of Step 2:  
> - Publish short form daily → get noticed.  
> - Offer 2–7 hours of long form → become known.  
> - Curate your brand associations → get rated where you want (niche, luxury, etc.).

## Step 3. Generate Signals of Interest

> Attention is useless unless you can tell who’s actually interested.

### 3.1 Use a high-converting landing page
Your landing page must have 4 parts:

1. **Hook**
   - Purpose: stop the scroll.
   - Two main types:
     - Frustration hook  
       - “Are you frustrated that you’re not getting [desired result]?”
       - Names the pain caused by *not* having your method / IP.
     - Readiness hook  
       - “Are you ready to [achieve desired outcome]?”
       - Invites people who are ready to move now.

2. **Value Proposition**
   - Explain how you solve that frustration or unlock that desired result.
   - Show what you improve:
     - Faster?
     - Cheaper?
     - Higher performance?
     - Better lifestyle/emotional payoff?

3. **Credibility**
   - Why should they believe you?
   - Options:
     - Your story / background
     - Results you’ve gotten
     - Stats / research / data
   - Often includes:
     - Bio + headshot
     - Past client results
     - Relevant facts

4. **Call to Action (CTA)**
   - Tell them exactly what to do next.
   - Examples:
     - “Start the assessment”
     - “Register for the workshop”
     - “Join the waitlist”
     - “Join the group”
   - When they click / submit → that’s a **signal of interest**  
     (aka: a lead)

### 3.2 What happens after they signal interest
- They’ve basically raised their hand and said:
  - “I want this outcome.”
  - “I think you can help.”
- You now have:
  - Their contact info
  - Their pain or goal
  - Proof they’re in-market

### 3.3 Example
- David Fraser, “Bunky Life”
  - Sells prefab cabin kits (“bunkies”) for families to build in the woods.
  - Landing page headline: “Are You Ready for the Bunky Life?”
  - Built it with scoreapp.com.
  - Result: thousands of leads (signals of interest).
  - Outcome: huge growth.

> Summary of Step 3:  
> - Use a landing page with Hook → Value → Credibility → CTA.  
> - Capture leads = capture buying intent.

---

## Step 4. Convert Sales

> Leads are nice. Revenue is nicer.

### 4.1 Track conversions with a LAPS Dashboard
- LAPS =  
  - **L**eads  
  - **A**ppointments  
  - **P**resentations  
  - **S**ales
- You measure:
  1. How many leads came in?  
  2. How many of those booked a 1:1 or group sales call/demo?  
  3. How many actually attended / saw the presentation of the core offering?  
  4. How many bought?

### 4.2 Example funnel math
- 100 leads
  - → 15 appointments
    - → 10 presentations
      - → 3 sales
- That gives you baseline conversion rates.
  - Your job is to improve each stage:
    - Can we get 100 → 20 appointments?
    - Can we get 15 → 15 show-ups?
    - Can we get 10 → 5 buyers?

### 4.3 The flow
- Product for Prospects (free learn)  
  ↓
- Landing page captures lead (signal of interest)  
  ↓
- Book appointment / invite to webinar or sales environment  
  ↓
- Present the Core Offering  
  ↓
- Ask for the sale

### 4.4 Your weekly job
- Review the LAPS dashboard every single week:
  - How many leads?
  - How many appointments booked?
  - How many presentations delivered?
  - How many closed sales?
- Brainstorm weekly:
  - How do we get more leads?
  - How do we increase show-up rate?
  - How do we make the presentation clearer / more valuable?
  - How do we close more confidently?

### 4.5 Tooling
- A tool like scoreapp.com:
  - Gives you landing pages / assessments (for signals of interest).
  - Captures and organizes leads.
  - Acts as a lightweight CRM to move people toward the sale.
  - Lets you export that data into:
    - Your LAPS dashboard (Google Sheets if you’re early)
    - A bigger CRM if you’re more mature.

> Summary of Step 4:  
> - Measure LAPS.  
> - Improve each stage, every week.  
> - Systematize going from “interested lead” → “signed client.”

---

## Step 5. Scale

> Scaling = spend money to amplify what's already working — not to “fix” what’s broken.

### 5.1 Calculate “Allowable Cost per Sale”
- Define:
  - Your core offer price.
  - What % of that revenue you’re okay reinvesting to acquire a sale.
- Example:
  - Core offer = $5,000.
  - Willing to spend 15% to acquire a customer.
  - 15% of $5,000 = $750.
  - Your **allowable cost per sale = $750**.

### 5.2 Calculate “Allowable Cost per Lead”
- Use the conversion data from your LAPS dashboard.
- Example:
  - From 100 leads, you close 3 sales.
  - If each sale can cost you up to $750 to acquire:
    - That means you can spend up to $750 × 3 = $2,250 to get 100 leads.
    - $2,250 / 100 = **$22.50 allowable cost per lead**.
- Interpretation:
  - If you can buy qualified leads for ≤ $22.50 each → you can profitably scale.

### 5.3 Use Paid Promotion Channels
Once you know your allowable costs, you can safely spend on:
- **Ads**
  - Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn / YouTube / Google / X
- **Joint ventures**
  - Pay influencers
  - Pay aligned brands to promote you
- **Paid outreach**
  - Pay someone to DM, call, or email potential buyers
- **Sponsorships**
  - Sponsor newsletters, events, YouTube channels, etc.

### 5.4 Scale Budget Gradually
- Month 1: “We can spend $10,000 on ads.”
  - Track: Are we hitting ≤ $22.50 per lead and ≤ $750 per sale?
- Month 2: Increase to $12,000 if the numbers hold.
- Month 3: $15,000.
- Month 4: $20,000.
- Keep reinvesting as long as you stay under:
  - Allowable cost per lead
  - Allowable cost per sale

> Summary of Step 5:  
> - Know what a customer is “allowed” to cost you.  
> - Buy traffic and leads under that price.  
> - Increase spend steadily while staying profitable.
